$progname is a program to bring the trunk branch of the current git 
chrome repository to last known good status.  If a number is provided 
on the command line, that is the revision to sync to.  Options:
	-m		Only valid if done on a branch other than trunk.
			After executing the base of the command, switch
			back to this branch and merge trunk into it.
	-M		Only valid if done on a branch other than trunk.
			If done on a branch other than trunk, brings
			trunk to the "git merge-base' of that branch
			and the trunk line (i.e. it may move trunk
			forward).
	-t		Merge to top of tree rather than LKGR.
	-G		Skip automatic gclient sync.
