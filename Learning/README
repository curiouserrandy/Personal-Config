Directories representing long term learning/investigation I want to do
on non-company proprietary tools (i.e. not stuff where my musings
should stay instide a firewall).  Strictly speaking, the Config files
aren't the right place for such things, but the Config files are the
files I've got with me everywhere, which is where I want these
directories to be accessible.
