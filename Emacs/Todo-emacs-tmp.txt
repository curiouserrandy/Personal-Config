* To scan

X-- Make sure to go back and go over nane.netapp.com/all.el; much stuff
   there.

* To do

X-- Pull out from nane.netapp.com/all.el into separate files:
	* Sandbox stuff (make generic)
	* Glimpse stuff (make generic; into grep-expanded.el)
	* Put into todo to make randy-open-console-connection into
   	  something that reads /u3/console/console_README.

-- Figure out what you want to do about the load path.  For now, I'm
   not modifying it.  Directories added to it in startup.el:
	* ~rsmith/lib
   I think I want to rethink this--the require/provide stuff makes it
   real simple to use load-path.  Maybe I'll prefix all the files in
   Config/Emacs with rs- and use require/provide.  Ok.  

X-- Not sure what to do about the default initialization file, and
   site-init.el.  site-init.el is loaded before my .emacs; default.el
   is loaded after and the load can be inhibitted by setting
   inhibit-default-init to t.  It's hard to do a general plan for
   these.  I should probably leave in what I have now (load default
   first and disable).  Or I could do this in system specific
   locations, which might make more sense.  Hmmm.  Under what
   circumstances will I ever want default.el loaded after my stuff?
   I'm going to plan on loading it first and inhibiting it.  Done in
   pre-system.el

-- Figure out general require/provide plans.  Going to have Emacs
   directories on load path as appropriate, and name my files so they
   don't conflict with global files.  Only minus about this is that I
   then really should setup the entire load path before I load any
   files and then use require in the all.el files.  Ok.  Do it.

X-- Make sandbox and grep stuff generic

X-- Figure out how to deal with python mode; what emacs' don't have it?
   There's both a python.el that is distributed with emacs (copyright
   2003,4; not clear what the first emacs it was distributed with was)
   that is different from and incompatible with python-mode.el.  Happy
   to switch over to generic emacs, but I need to make sure that it
   exists on all machines on which I'm likely to use python :-}.
   Check it on desktop/server computer, and make sure that you don't
   require it until you need it.  Moving local copy of python-mode.el
   into "Old".  I think I'll just leave this problem be and deal with
   it as I run into it.

-- Reexamine setting up comint so that it doesn't do editting in the
   sub buffer (terminal type).

X-- Figure out how to test that in keys.el and structure keys.el.  In
   general, go over keys.el.

-- Need to include pulling in mh tools.  Also grep-expanded.el (should
   be at top level).

-- Pull in split mode.

* Testing

-- Do the arrow keys work on various keyboards?  

-- Make sure ispell works

-- Make sure sending email from the various computers on which you
   work works.  Tricky.



* Notes

-- Also not pulling in the Vt100 Esc-[ keymap stuff; I don't think I
   need that, so I want to leave it out until I do.  Will the arrow
   keys work without it?
-- Leaving off the ispell auto-loda stuff as well.  May want to go
   back and put that in.
-- I didn't copy randy-countalist-increment over; not used and I'd
   like to rewrite it if I need it again. 

-- Skipping "dired-compress-print"; that's almost certainly way out of
   date by now.  Similarly for the dired bindings, which are rmail and
   comporess print specic.

-- Also skipping randy-check-file-visiting-compressed

-- Skipping gnus settings & sendmail setting (may need to revisit
   that).

-- Skipping everything rmail related.

-- Skipped (eliminated) randy-goto-todo and randy-goto-schedule.
