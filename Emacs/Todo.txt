Notes on things I might want to do with emacs customization in the future.

;;; TODO:
;;;	*) Ability to read this file (startup.el) from a different account.
;;;	*) Move all machine specific stuff out to a separate file.
;;;	*) Directory changing command.
;;;	*) Menu of tags tables
;;;	*) Grep in a dired should cd to the current (position wise)
;;;	   subdirectory before executing.
;;;	*) C-p and C-n in rmail summary not changing the rmail buffer.
;;;	*) Function to find a file wherever it is in the backing list.
;;;	*) Function to visit file under point (in other window and in
;;;	   current window).
;;;	*) Save RMAIL file if idle for more than one hour.  Kill buffer if
;;;	   idle for more than two hours(?)
;;;	*) Get C language auto-filling to work the way you'd like.
;;;	*) Way to set window boundaries based on the mouse?  (May already
;;;	   exist).
;;;	*) Interactive function "narrow buffer to region"
;;;	*) Function to pop up a page, and then return directly to the
;;;	   previous position.  Maybe make general?  marks probably do that.
;;;	*) Completion in C code needs to be on C symbols, not partial symbols.
;;;	*) Play with completion.
;;;	*) Mouse command to bring line I click on to top of screen.
;;;	*) Deal somehow with file aliasing through symbolic links.

;;; Shell-mode function to send a cd to the shell to move to
;;; whatever directory is current in the other window.  Does current
;;; dired have anything like this?  XXX

;;; Functions to force deletion of symlinks when they are saved to.
;;; XXX

;;; List all (C) functions within a file.
;;; XXX

;;; Dired stuff not put in; I need to decide what to keep and what to
;;; toss.  Stuff that would be included:   (XXX)
;;;	*) print file on current line (includes dealing with dvi files).
;;;	*) Enscript file on current line
;;;	*) Execute current file.
;;;	*) Copy current file to <file>.distrib
;;;	*) Make a directory.
;;;	*) UUencode the current file.  UUdecode the current file.
;;;	*) Visit Makefile in directory under cursor.
;;;	*) Flag (for deletion) all files matching regexp.
;;;	*) Flag all files ending in .o (for deletion).
;;;	*) Read current file into rmail.
;;;	*) Load current file as emacs lisp code.
