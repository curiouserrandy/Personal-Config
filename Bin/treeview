!#/usr/bin/env python

# Display a directory tree as a graph.  Relies on having the "dot" executable 
# on the path.

# Basic algorithm:
#	* Read arguments (single argument, directory)
#	* Find all directories under that argument.  (*)
#	* Create a temporary file
#	* Output a digraph to that temporary file.  Visible names are
#	  just directory entry name, actual names have __ in place of slashes
#	  with an XXX prefix (in case the top level is ".")
#	* Use dot to turn that into a .png
#	* Display the .png inside of python.  This probably requires PIL and 
#	  getting the GM widget to work right.
#	* When that widget is exitted, destroy all temp files.

# (*) Eventually, I also want to discover symlinks within the directory
# tree and store them, but not for the first round.
