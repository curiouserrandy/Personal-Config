$progname executes an command in the backgroud, with output going to a file.  
The command (and command options) start by default at the first
non-flag argument.  The command executed and the process group are output
to the file, and the process group is also outputted to the controlling
terminal before $progname returns.  When the command completes, a completion
notification and exit status
will also be output into the file.
Options:
	-o <file>	Output file.  This defauls to <command>.log.  If the
			specified or defaulted output file would result in
			overwriting an already existing file, that file
			is moved to the first to the first available backup
			file (<name>.~<n>~)
	-x<geometry>	Says that an xterm should be spawned to follow the
			command output as it occurs.  The option <geometry>
			specifies where this window will appear; <geometry>
			defaults to -0+0.
	-a 		Append to output file if it exists rather that
			creating a new backup file.
	-1		Confirm that the :1 X display is available, and
			use DISPLAY=:1.0 for the command (but not for the
			Xterm above).
	-D		Turn on command echoing.
