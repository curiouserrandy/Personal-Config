## How to clone a repository from github
   git clone https://github.com/<user?>/<repo>

## Setting up an upstream repository   
   In .git/config:
	[remote "upstream"]
		url = https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy
		fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/upstream/*
   Note that if you name an unknown (or presumably non-public)
   repository, you'll get various prompts for authentication rather
   than just "Repository does not exist".

## SSH keys can be found by profile navigation after login; direct URL
   is https://github.com/settings/keys.
   Can add new keys.

## Can test to see if your key is working properly by doing
   ssh -T git@github.com.  Success won't give you a shell, but it will
   tell you you've successfully authenticated.

## I *think* for repositories to use this, they have to have the
   remote specified via an ssh url.  For example, the URL that appears
   to work for my config repository is:
   git@github.com:curiouserrandy/Personal-Config.git.

   multiple repositories).
