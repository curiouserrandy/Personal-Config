	[remote "upstream"]
		url = https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy
		fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/upstream/*

   repository, you'll get various prompts for authentication rather
   than just "Repository does not exist".

   repositories on github

?? How to submit a pull request (to the extent it's identical for
   multiple repositories).
