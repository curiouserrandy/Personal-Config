-- SD Card access: Try plugging one into my hub and see what happens.
   After some guesses (mini-SD card plugs into adapter right side up,
   they need to be reversed plugging into hub the way it's currently
   setup) the drive just showed up on my desktop.  Copied gcode onto
   it, hopefully correctly.  May want to recreate in lab just to make
   sure I have it right.  On top mini card with adapter on the right.

## Security issues: It's a lot safer than a USB stick, but it ain't
   safe if someone's actively trying to compromise your file system
   mount code.  Think about how you want to protect yourself
   transferring data at AA.  Have asked for suggestions on Tesseral.
   Note that this threat model involves someone putting a virus *on
   the Prusa printers*, which is (much) less likely to me than putting
   one on the lab windows machine; wouldn't be done by a script
   kiddie.  Ok, I'd be willing to roll these dice, but I'd still
   rather come up with a pathway that doesn't involve trusting the SD
   card when it comes back from the printer.

-- My mac -> Prusa pathway:
	* uy an actual SD card for transferring your prints.
	* Possibly also a stand-alone Mac->SD card interface.
	* Figure out how to full format it from the mac, and
	* Figure out how to make sure it doesn't auto-mount when
   	  attached to the mac.
