-- Overview
	Defuns must be instrumented before edebug will work
	Entry into instrumented function triggers edebug-initial-mode
	(default 'step').

-- Instrumenting
	C-u C-M-x			; Actually inverts value of below
	(setq edebug-all-defs t)	; All defs evaled will be instrumented

-- Commands
	# Execution modes
	S: stop
	<spc>: step
	n: next
	t: trace
	T: rapid trace
	g: go until breakpoint
	G: Go ignoring breakpoints
	c: continuing, pausing 1s at each breakpoint
	C: continuing, pausing 0s at each breakpoint
	
	# Jumping
	h: Proceed to here
	f: run one sexp
	o: run until end of containing sexp
	i: Step into function or macro

	# Breakpoints
	b: Set breakpiont at first stop point after point (prefix for temp)
	u: Unset breakpoint
	x <CONDITION>: Conditional breakpoint
	B: Move to next breakpoint (no execution, just move)

	## Eval
	E: Switch to eval list buffer (lisp interaction)
	C-c C-u: Build a new evaluation list from contents of buffer
	C-c C-d: Delete evaluation list point is in
	C-c C-w: Switch back to source

	q: top-level
	Q: top-level-nonstop

	r: redisplay expression result
	d: edebug-backtrace

	e: evaluate sexp in context of program

	## Can evalute expressions interactively in buffer *edebug*
	## Can setup expressions to be evaluated automatically at each stop
