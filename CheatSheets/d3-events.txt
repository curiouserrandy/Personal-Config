-- d3.zoom(): Creates a zoom behavior (which is a callable object).
   When the behavior is created, it is then called on a selection
   (usually by <selection>.call()) to implement the behavior.  Methods
   to specify the zoom behavior:
	* Base setup is
	  <selection>.call(
	    d3.zoom().on("zoom", (event) => {
	      <selection>.attr("transform", event.transform);
	    })
	  );
	  That enables scroll wheel zooming.
	?? It's really unclear to me what the zoom point is.  It
   	  doesn't appear to be where the mouse is.

-- d3.drag(): Creates a drag behavior, directly parallel to the
   above.
