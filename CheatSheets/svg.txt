## Random notes.  <> are elements, unbracketed at attributes that
   apply to multiple elements.  

## <defs>.  Creates graphical elements that will be used somewhere
   else in the render (e.g. via <use>).
   
## <path>.  Most flexible element for defining a shape.  Shape defined
   by the "d" attribute, which is a string with a series of path
   commands
   (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/d#path_commands).
   All commands are single letters followed by coordinates.  
   Most important such commands are moveto, lineto, cubic bezier,
   quadratic bezier, elliptical arc, close path.

## stroke.  Defines the color (including gradient or pattern; svg has
   "paint servers" for that purpose) of the stroke of the element in
   question.

## <svg>
