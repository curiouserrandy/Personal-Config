{d3,sel}.select{,All}(<selector>):
	Select the first/all element(s) in the document/under the object that
	matches the specified selector.  Selection from a previous
	selector moves the node topology in the ancester to the
	grouping topology in the descendant.
	
sel.data(<data>): Associate the data specified by <data> with the selection.
	* Note that the shape of the data generally should be an
	  array, which is then split among the nodes in the selection
	  (creating enter/exit as you'd expect).
	* <data> may be a function; if it is, it is passed the data of
	  the parent selection node.
	* The array passed or returned from the function is split at
	  the group->node level; i.e. if you have groups selection and
	  pass a function, the function is called for each element in
	  the original selection, and returns an array that is splitup
	  for the nodes in the group defined by that element.
	? It appears that if there's a single element in each group,
	  you can return a singleton rather than an array.  But it may
	  be that this is only true for .select() results.  Would be
	  worth figuring out.
