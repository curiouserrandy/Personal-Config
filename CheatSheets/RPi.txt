## Estimated power draw of RPi: 2.5 - 5 W, $1/month.   

## https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/specifications/
## RPi 4b: Micro-HDMI, USB-C power, USB3 & USB2 connectors, Gigabit ethernet
## Case: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3793664
   Config: No mounts, standard, standard.
   Config axes of STL files:
	# BOTTOM-
   	* {,-8820,_100MM_VESA,_75MM_VESA}
	* {,_BLANK}
   
	# GRILL_
	* {_25MM,_30MM,_40MM}

## The image on the uSD card is a file system, but not a standard unix
   one; I'm guessing there's another layer of container (there are
   various img files, for instance).  However, cmdline.txt has the
   "quiet" flag mentioned above.  



## Notes on network booting:   
	* /var/log is no longer the hotness; instead you have to go
   	  through systemd using journalctl (see 'man journalctl').   
	* Raspberry Pi NetworkManager boot log in
   	  RPiInvestigation/NetworkManager-booting.log.
