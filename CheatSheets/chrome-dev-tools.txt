## Events:
	* Whatever element is currently being inspected can be
	  referred to as $0 in the console. 
	* monitorEvents($0, <event type as sring) will output events
	  to the console of that type that hit that element (or any
	  child) until you unmonitorEvents().	  

## Breakpoints:
	* A breakpoint can be coded directly via the statement "debugger;"
