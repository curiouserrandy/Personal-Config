## Notes on python isntalls from Nathan:
	* https://xkcd.com/1987 :-J (but has some real info)
	* Don't use python 2.7
	* pyenv and pyenv-virtualenv from homebrew
	* "in our default dotfiles repo, there's a bunch of tooling in
	  everyone's bashrc/zshrc that uses pyenv to set up a default
	  virtualenv and put a .pyversion in everyone's homedir to
	  make sure that if you run pip install whatever you're always
	  installing that into your personal virutalenv rather than
	  anywhere in the system dirs"
	* "in each git repo that uses python, there is a makefile with
	  a setup target, or a setup.sh script that creates a
	  virtualenv just for that project and uses poetry to control
	  the installed dependencies"
	* "getting pyenv and poetry to play nicely together was
	  absolutely the hardest part of all of this; it looks like
	  this:" (Not copying what it looks like--this seems like what
	  one needs if doing this at a installed base shop.)
